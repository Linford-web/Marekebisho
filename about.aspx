       <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Vanara Correctional Centre was started in 2022</p>
        <p>Vanara is a mens'correctional centre located in Gataka for Citizens and non citizens between 18 and 50 years</p>


        <h2>Security </h2>
  
        <p class="auto-style2">In almost 1 year of ministry, we’ve never had an incident that compromised the safety of one of our Teammates.
        Safety is of the utmost concern to correctional facilities. </p>
      <p>  Facilities often have additional personnel on duty during our visits to provide an extra margin of safety.</p>

            <p>Facility security is tight with many restrictions, 
        and we insist on everyone being properly trained and observing our “Do’s and Don’ts.” </p>


        <h2>Treatment of Prisoners</h2>
        <p>There is no discrimination on grounds of
race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth
or other status. </p>

        <p>It is necessary to respect the religious beliefs and moral precepts of the group
to which a prisoner belongs. </p>
